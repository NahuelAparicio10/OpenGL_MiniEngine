**GOAL** 

Develop a small rendering engine in C++ using OpenGL that integrates multiple techniques learned throughout the course, with a focus on real-time lighting. The final project had to demonstrate features such as a day/night cycle, ambient lighting, and dynamic flashlight illumination.

**How I resolved it**

I structured the engine using a modular component-based approach organizing the code into managers (for objects, maps, programs, and time) and core components (Transform, MeshRenderer, Material, Texture). I implemented custom shaders (vertex, fragment, and geometry) to handle lighting effects such as directional sun/moon cycles and spotlights for the flashlight. The camera and input manager allowed free navigation in the scene, while the procedural map generation system ensured variety on each run.

**What I learned**

I learned how to architect a small graphics engine using OpenGL, separating responsibilities into reusable components and managers. I deepened my understanding of GLSL shader programming, especially for dynamic lighting, and practiced designing a clean codebase similar to an ECS structure which I really like from Unity projects I made before. This project also taught me how to integrate multiple rendering feature such as camera, input, textures, and shaders into a cohesive system.
